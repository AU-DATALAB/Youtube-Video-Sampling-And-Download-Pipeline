# Youtube-Download-DATALAB

This repository provides a pipeline for downloading YouTube videos from participants who have donated their data as part of the **[Nordic YouTube Data Donation Project](https://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1954799/FULLTEXT01.pdf)**. The project explores how digital platforms shape public discourse, and how user-contributed data can be collected and processed for research under strict ethical and legal safeguards.  

The repository leverages [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), a robust open-source command-line tool for downloading videos and associated metadata from YouTube.
